# üß∂KnitPix
KnitPix is an open-source Java application that converts images into knitting patterns. Whether you need a black-and-white contour version or a colorized pattern using your available wool colors, this tool aims to simplify the process for knitters to make custom pattern.

## üé®Example
Below is an example created using a combination of tools, including color quantization with a custom palette and a blocky blur effect. This demonstrates the goal of KnitPix: to convert an image into a knitting chart based on the available wool colors.

In this example, the image is simplified using a palette of five colors.

## üåüWhy This Project Exists
This project started as a tool for my mother to convert images into knit patterns. However, I decided to take this opportunity to:
- Learn how to manage an open-source project.
- Get hands-on experience with OpenGL using LWJGL for future projects.
- Build a performance-heavy application while gaining efficiency in Java and graphics programming.

## üåçWhy Open Source?
By making this project open source, I hope to:
- Provide a free and accessible tool for anyone who needs it.
- Attract experienced programmers to help refine and optimize the codebase.
- Create a learning-friendly environment where both experienced and less experienced developers can collaborate to write professional-quality code.

## ‚ú®Features
- Convert images into knitting patterns.
- Support for:
    - Black and white contour-based patterns.
    - Color-based patterns using a predefined set of wool colors.
- Full Java implementation using LWJGL (which is overkill, but is intended as a learning experience for future projects!).
- OpenGL rendering for performance optimization and visualization.

## üöÄGetting Started
